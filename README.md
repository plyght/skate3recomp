An unofficial native recompilation of the Xbox 360 version of Skate 3, supporting Windows, Linux, macOS, and (experimentally, self-built) iOS.

As of v2.0.0, the game runs on a native renderer built directly on Direct3D 12 and Vulkan instead of emulating the Xbox 360 GPU. Compared to the emulated renderer it delivers more than twice the frame rate at roughly a quarter of the GPU power draw, and on Apple Silicon the frame rate uplift is closer to 10x.

The new native renderer is early and is likely to have issues, I haven't tested the game all the way through.

The project does not include Skate 3 retail game files. To run or build the project, you must provide files from your own legally obtained Xbox 360 copy of Skate 3.

## How Do I Play?

Notes:

- The Windows version is the most tested, followed by Linux, and then macOS.
- On some hardware configurations, you may have a better experience running the Windows version through a translation layer like Proton rather than the native Linux build itself.
- The macOS ARM build is experimental and more prone to issues.

### Windows

1. Download the latest release Skate3Recomp-Windows.zip from the releases page.
2. Extract it anywhere you like, to a folder you control.
3. Run skate3.exe.
4. Click "Select ISO" to select your legally obtained copy of Skate 3.
5. Wait for the installer to extract the game files.
6. Click "Start Game".

### Linux

1. Download the latest release Skate3Recomp-Linux.zip from the releases page.
2. Extract it anywhere you like, to a folder you control.
3. Run skate3.
4. Click "Select ISO" to select your legally obtained copy of Skate 3.
5. Wait for the installer to extract the game files.
6. Click "Start Game".

### macOS (ARM / Experimental)

1. Download the latest release Skate3Recomp-macOS.zip from the releases page.
2. Extract it anywhere you like, to a folder you control.
3. Run the game by opening the skate3recomp app. Game files, saves and settings are kept in the folder containing the app, so keep it in a folder you control rather than in Downloads or Applications.
4. The first time, right-click the app and choose Open, or approve it under System Settings > Privacy & Security, before macOS will allow it to run.
5. Click "Select ISO" to select your legally obtained copy of Skate 3.
6. Wait for the installer to extract the game files.
7. Click "Start Game".

### iOS / iPadOS (Experimental, build it yourself)

The iOS version has to be built on your own Mac from your own disc, because the
app contains code recompiled from it. See [iOS Build](#ios-build-iphone--ipad).

1. Build `Skate3Recomp.ipa` once with `ios/build.sh` and install it with SideStore, AltStore or Xcode.
2. Open the app and choose your ISO in the picker. It can sit anywhere in Files, for example in the app's own folder under On My iPhone > Skate 3 Recomp. The game files are extracted on the device. Rebuilding is never needed for this step.
3. The title update installs itself from the copy bundled at build time.
4. Play with the on-screen touch controls or any MFi, Xbox, DualSense or Switch controller.

## Native Renderer

Since v2.0.0 the game no longer relies on emulating the Xbox 360 GPU. A native renderer draws the game directly through Direct3D 12 or Vulkan, covering the entire game: gameplay, menus, HUD, loading screens, videos, and the photo, replay, skater, and park editors. It runs exact ports of the game's own material shading for the world, characters, vehicles, and water, so the image stays at close visual parity with the original console output while running far faster and more efficiently.

- The native renderer is on by default. Settings > Video > Renderer switches between Native and Emulated live, and F5 hot-toggles between them at any time. If the native renderer ever hits an unrecoverable error, the game falls back to the emulated renderer and shows a corner indicator; F5 retries the native path.
- On Windows, a single build ships both graphics API backends: Settings > Video > Graphics API selects DirectX 12 or Vulkan (applied with Apply & Restart; DirectX 12 is preferred by default). Linux uses Vulkan, and macOS uses Vulkan through MoltenVK.
- Optional enhancements beyond the original game live under Settings > Video: MSAA up to 8x, enhanced real-time sun shadows with contact-hardening soft shadows, ambient occlusion, bloom, volumetric lighting, extended draw distance and world streaming, render scale up to 3x, and true ultrawide.

Known issues:

- Occasional texture and asset pop-in or brief flicker while streaming quickly around the map (also present in the emulated renderer)
- Issues with rendering skater customization options in the edit skater mode (skin, hair, clothing etc.)
- Hall of Meat currently not rendered properly (missing bone highlights etc.)
- Skate parks and park editing currently have some general visual parity / rendering issues

## Installing DLC

To use DLC, you must provide package files from your own legally obtained Xbox 360 DLC.

Create a `dlc` folder either beside the executable, inside the installed game folder,
or in the user data folder. Place the DLC package files in that
folder and start the game.

## Saves and Portable Mode

Saved games live in the user data folder by default (`%APPDATA%\skate3`, i.e.
`AppData\Roaming\skate3`, on Windows). Two portable options are available:

- Create a `saves` folder next to the executable and the game keeps saved games
  there instead. The folder must exist before launch, and existing saves are not
  migrated automatically - copy them over from the user data folder.
- Create an empty `portable.txt` file next to the executable to keep all user
  data in the executable's folder.

## True Ultrawide

The builds include an experimental true ultrawide mode: the native renderer draws the world at your display's full aspect ratio (21:9 and wider) with a matching wider field of view, while the HUD and menus stay centered and undistorted. Enable it via the Aspect Ratio setting or `skate3_ultrawide = true`. It requires the native renderer; with the emulated renderer the game presents in standard 16:9. Rendering more of the scene costs proportionally more GPU time.

## Controls

- Standard Xbox controls using an Xbox controller are the preferred and main input method.
- PlayStation (DualShock/DualSense), Switch and most generic controllers are supported through the SDL controller backend: set Settings > Controls > Controller Backend to SDL and restart the game. Steam Input through XInput also works. On Linux and macOS the SDL backend is always used, so these controllers work out of the box.
- Keyboard controls can be enabled in the game settings menu.
- Press Escape on keyboard or (RB + Start) on the controller to open the game settings menu. The chord can be changed in Settings > Controls.

- On iOS, on-screen touch controls are shown while no controller is connected:
  - **Left stick:** steering and pushing. It floats, so its center is wherever your thumb lands.
  - **Right stick:** a large floating stick marked FLICK, for Flick-It tricks.
  - **Buttons:** ABXY, which you can slide between without lifting, plus the bumpers, triggers, Back/Start, L3/R3 and the d-pad.
  - **Menu button:** tap it to open the settings menu. Long-press it to open the layout editor, where you can drag controls, resize or hide them, change the opacity or scale, or reset. Layouts are saved to `Documents/skate3/touch_layout.toml`.
  - **Controllers:** connecting a controller hides the touch controls, and touching the screen brings them back. To turn them off entirely, set `touch_controls = false` in `Documents/skate3/settings.toml`.

### Keyboard Keybinds

- Left stick: W/A/S/D
- Right stick: mouse movement
- A/B/X/Y: Space/C/E/F
- LT/RT: RMB/LMB
- LB/RB: Q/R
- Left stick press: Shift
- Right stick press: MMB
- Back/Start: Tab/Return

## Building from Source

All platforms build with CMake 3.25+, Ninja, and Clang 18 or newer - ReXGlue
requires Clang, so MSVC and Apple Clang are not supported. On Windows, install
[LLVM for Windows](https://releases.llvm.org/) and Ninja.

Clone with submodules:

```sh
git clone --recursive <repo-url> skate3recomp
cd skate3recomp
```

If you already cloned without submodules:

```sh
git submodule sync --recursive
git submodule update --init --recursive --jobs "$(nproc 2>/dev/null || echo 4)"
```

The build-time codegen needs an extracted game dump containing `default.xex` and
`data/webkit/EAWebkit.xex`. Put that dump in `game/`, or pass a path with
`SKATE3_GAME_DATA_ROOT`.

The codegen should also be given the Skate 3 Title Update 3 package - the same
`TU_12K2276_000000C000000.00000000000O3` file the in-game title update
installer downloads. Place it in the repository root under its original name,
or pass a path with `-DSKATE3_TITLE_UPDATE_PACKAGE=`. With the package
present, the build extracts the update patches and recompiles the TU3-patched
executables - the configuration used by release builds, whose runtime requires
the title update to be staged before the game will boot. Without the package,
codegen falls back to the unpatched retail image; that path is no longer
regularly tested, and `generate-all` reporting unresolved calls on a clean
retail dump is the usual symptom of building without the title update.

Generate the recompiled source first:

```sh
cmake --preset relwithdebinfo -DSKATE3_GAME_DATA_ROOT="$PWD/game"
cmake --build --preset relwithdebinfo --target generate-all --parallel
```

Then reconfigure so CMake sees the generated source lists and build:

```sh
cmake --preset relwithdebinfo -DSKATE3_GAME_DATA_ROOT="$PWD/game"
cmake --build --preset relwithdebinfo --parallel
```

For release packaging, use the `release` preset on Windows, the
`linux-release` preset on Linux, or the `macos-release` preset on macOS.

The native renderer's HLSL sources live in `src/native/shaders` and are
embedded into the build automatically. The matching Vulkan SPIR-V binaries are
pre-compiled offline with DXC and committed under `src/native/shaders/spirv`,
so building needs no shader tooling; the SPIR-V header only needs regenerating
after editing the HLSL.

## Ubuntu/Linux Build

These instructions target Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on x86_64. Other distributions need
the same toolchain shape: CMake, Ninja, Clang 20 or newer, Vulkan development
headers, GTK 3 development headers, and SDL-compatible audio/input development
packages.

ReXGlue requires Clang. Clang 20 is recommended on Ubuntu because it matches the
Linux toolchain used by the rexglue SDK CI and avoids Ubuntu 24.04's
Clang 18/libstdc++ `std::expected` feature-test mismatch.

Install LLVM's apt repository and dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wget gnupg lsb-release software-properties-common
wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
chmod +x llvm.sh
sudo ./llvm.sh 20
sudo apt install -y \
  git cmake ninja-build build-essential pkg-config p7zip-full \
  clang-20 lld-20 \
  libgtk-3-dev libx11-xcb-dev \
  libvulkan-dev vulkan-tools mesa-vulkan-drivers \
  libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libpipewire-0.3-dev libudev-dev
```

Optional packages improve controller/input and diagnostics coverage in SDL:

```sh
sudo apt install -y libusb-1.0-0-dev libunwind-dev libibus-1.0-dev liburing-dev
```

Initialize submodules as described above, then configure, generate,
reconfigure, and build a development build:

```sh
cmake --preset linux-relwithdebinfo -DSKATE3_GAME_DATA_ROOT="$PWD/game"
cmake --build --preset linux-relwithdebinfo --target generate-all --parallel
cmake --preset linux-relwithdebinfo -DSKATE3_GAME_DATA_ROOT="$PWD/game"
cmake --build --preset linux-relwithdebinfo --parallel
```

Build a Linux release:

```sh
cmake --preset linux-release -DSKATE3_GAME_DATA_ROOT="$PWD/game"
cmake --build --preset linux-release --target generate-all --parallel
cmake --preset linux-release -DSKATE3_GAME_DATA_ROOT="$PWD/game"
cmake --build --preset linux-release --parallel
```

The release artifacts are:

```text
out/build/linux-release/skate3
out/build/linux-release/librexruntime.so
```

## macOS Build (Apple Silicon)

macOS builds use Homebrew LLVM - the `macos-*` presets expect the toolchain at
`/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm`. Vulkan is provided by MoltenVK; the build copies the
library next to the executable and writes a `MoltenVK_icd.json`, looking in
`$VULKAN_SDK/lib`, `/opt/homebrew/lib`, and `/usr/local/lib`.

```sh
brew install llvm cmake ninja molten-vk
```

Configure, generate, reconfigure, and build a release:

```sh
cmake --preset macos-release -DSKATE3_GAME_DATA_ROOT="$PWD/game"
cmake --build --preset macos-release --target generate-all --parallel
cmake --preset macos-release -DSKATE3_GAME_DATA_ROOT="$PWD/game"
cmake --build --preset macos-release --parallel
```

The release artifacts are `out/build/macos-release/skate3` and
`librexruntime.dylib`, plus the MoltenVK library and ICD manifest beside them.

## iOS Build (iPhone / iPad)

**This build is for personal use only.** The `.ipa` contains code recompiled from
your own copy of the game, so install it only on your own devices and do not share
or upload it. The ISO and the title update are never included in this repository.

Requirements:

- A Mac with Xcode, which provides the iOS 26 SDK, `ld` and `codesign`
- `brew install llvm cmake ninja`. ReXGlue needs upstream Clang; Apple Clang is not supported.
- An extracted dump of your Skate 3 disc containing `default.xex` and `data/`
- The Title Update 3 package, `TU_12K2276_000000C000000.00000000000O3`
- An iPhone or iPad on iOS 26 or later. ProMotion models (iPhone Pro and iPad Pro) can run at 120 fps, and 8 GB RAM models are recommended.

Build:

```sh
ios/build.sh --game /path/to/your/dump --tu /path/to/TU_12K2276_000000C000000.00000000000O3
# Add --extended-va if you sign with a paid Apple developer account (see below).
```

The script performs these steps:

1. It applies the SDK iOS patch from `patches/`.
2. It runs the recompiler with a macOS host build (`generate-all`).
3. It downloads a static MoltenVK, unless `VULKAN_SDK` points at the LunarG SDK.
4. It cross-compiles with the `ios-release` preset.
5. It writes `out/build/ios-release/Skate3Recomp.ipa`.

You build it once. After that, the ISO is chosen on the device, and you only rebuild after updating this project.

Install:

- **SideStore / AltStore (free Apple ID):** open the `.ipa` in the app. Free accounts must refresh the app every 7 days, which re-signs it without rebuilding.
- **Xcode (paid or free account):** use Window > Devices and Simulators, then drag the `.app` or `.ipa` onto your device. Re-sign it with your team first if Xcode asks.

Memory and entitlements:

- The app requests `increased-memory-limit` so the Xbox 360's 512 MB of RAM, the recompiled code and the GPU buffers fit in memory.
- With a free account there is no extended virtual addressing. The runtime then automatically uses a compact guest memory layout: a 4 GB guest span, with the physical view mapped separately.
- With a paid account, `--extended-va` adds `com.apple.developer.kernel.extended-virtual-addressing` and keeps the desktop layout.

Rendering and power:

- **Renderer:** iOS uses the same native renderer as the desktop builds, running on Metal through a statically linked MoltenVK.
- **Frame pacing:** presentation is vsynced. On ProMotion displays the guest is paced to the full refresh rate, which is 120 fps.
- **Low-power waits:** frame pacing sleeps on a precise kernel timer instead of spinning, and the GPU command processor's waits sleep instead of yield-spinning (`gpu_low_power_waits`). Both also apply to macOS.
- **First-run defaults:** iOS starts at 1x render scale with 2x MSAA and with SSAO and PCSS shadows off, so it can hold 120 fps on battery. Raise these in Settings > Video if your device has headroom.
- **Backgrounding:** when the app goes to the background, rendering and audio pause.

Known limitations:

- The iOS port is untested on hardware, so expect bugs.
- Changing a setting that needs a restart closes the app; reopen it from the home screen.
- Debuggers stop on the guest memory faults the runtime uses for GPU write tracking. In LLDB, run `process handle SIGSEGV SIGBUS -s false -n false -p true`.

## Running a Development Build

Run the built executable directly with a game dump. On Linux:

```sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/third_party/rexglue-sdk/out/linux-amd64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}" \
  ./out/build/linux-relwithdebinfo/skate3 --game_data_root="$PWD/game"
```

On Windows:

```powershell
.\out\build\relwithdebinfo\skate3.exe --game_data_root="$PWD\game"
```

Keyboard-to-controller emulation is off by default; enable it in
Settings > Controls > Mouse & Keyboard Mode.

Fullscreen is on by default. Pass `--fullscreen=false` to start windowed.
On Windows, ultrawide displays are detected automatically in fullscreen. For an
ultrawide window, pass matching `--window_width` and `--window_height` values;
the native renderer then draws true widescreen frames at that aspect.

## rexglue Fork

`third_party/rexglue-sdk` is pinned as a Git submodule to the
`skate3-sdk-clean` branch of the Skate-specific rexglue fork. Clone
recursively or run:

```sh
git submodule sync --recursive
git submodule update --init --recursive --jobs "$(nproc 2>/dev/null || echo 4)"
```

The fork is based on rexglue's 0.8.0 release line and contains the Skate 3
runtime, codegen, input, timing, the Direct3D 12 and Vulkan backends used by
the native renderer, the settings overlay, and the Linux and macOS fixes
needed by this project.
